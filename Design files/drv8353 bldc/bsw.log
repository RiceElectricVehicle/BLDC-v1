2019-11-04 13:41:57 9312  [WARNING] Warning: One or more nets are completely unrouted.  Do you want to connect them using "virtual", Manhattan-style routing?  (Does not apply to power-supply nets.)  Note: This process will begin by determining the detailed routing status of every net on the board, which can be very time-consuming (especially if some power-supply nets are mistakenly identified as signal nets).  If you prefer to skip this process now, you can run it later using Edit > Connect Nets with Manhattan Routing. - The "No" button was selected

2019-11-04 14:00:28 9312  [WARNING] Warning: To analyze a power / ground net, use the power-integrity features on the Simulate PI or Export > Model menus.
2019-11-04 14:00:43 9312     [INFO] This design's .HYP file was created by a PCB translator that did not record whether the physical information is sufficiently detailed for power-integrity analysis (especially metal areas and via clearances).  Most likely, the translator was an older version not upgraded for PI usage.  PI simulation may therefore produce less-accurate results.
